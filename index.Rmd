# Prerequisites

This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

For now, you have to install the development versions of **bookdown**, **rmarkdown**, and **knitr**:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(
  c("bookdown", "knitr"),
  repos = c("http://yihui.name/xran", "http://cran.rstudio.com")
)
```

Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter.
